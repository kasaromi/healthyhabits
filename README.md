## What? 
Situation: Preventative care is one of the key focuses of the NHS over the next years. There are multiple venues (physical or virtual) that enable people to both know what's good for them in terms of looking after their health ("best practices" - how to quit smoking, exercise more, drink less, practice mindfulness etc), and multiple venues through which to carry out or monitor progress on said best practices (gyms, endomondo, headspace, etc).

Complication: Despite the general availability of preventative tools and best practices, there are still huge opportunities in preventative care, due mostly to the fact that people fail to make habits out of best practices.

Question: How to leverage technology to "empower" people to build healthy habits?

Answer: TBD. My intuition is that most people generally respond well to "game" environments - the amount of time spent on playing mindless games is amazing - the on thing they do have and exploit well is immediate feedback loops and a sense of a "purpose" that is both challenging and achievable.
